    "\n",
    "The Earthcube Geosemantics Framework (http://hcgs.ncsa.illinois.edu/) developed a prototype of a decentralized framework that combines the Linked Data and RESTful web services to annotate, connect, integrate, and reason about integration of geoscience resources. The framework allows the semantic enrichment of web resources and semantic mediation among heterogeneous geoscience resources, such as models and data. \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides examples on how the Semantic Annotation Service can be used to manage linked controlled vocabularies using JSON Linked Data (JSON-LD), including how to query the built-in RDF graphs for existing linked standard vocabularies based on the Community Surface Dynamics Modeling System (CSDMS), Observations Data Model (ODM2) and Unidata udunits2 vocabularies, how to query build-in crosswalks between CSDMS and ODM2 vocabularies using SKOS, and how to add new linked vocabularies to the service. JSON-LD based definitions provided by these endpoints will be used to annotate sample data available within the IML Critical Zone Observatory data repository using the Clowder Web Service API (https://data.imlczo.org/). By supporting JSON-LD, the Semantic Annotation Service and the Clowder framework provide examples on how portable and semantically defined metadata can be used to better annotate data across repositories and services."

    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "We face many challenges in the process of extracting meaningful information from data. Frequently, these obstacle  compel scientists to perform the integration of models with data manually. Manual integration becomes exponentially difficult when a user aims to integrate long-tail data (data collected by individual researchers or small research groups) and long-tail models (models developed by individuals or small modeling communities). We focus on these long-tail resources because despite their often-narrow scope, they have significant impacts in scientific studies and present an opportunity for addressing critical gaps through automated integration. The goal of the Goesemantics Framework is to provide a framework rooted in semantic techniques and approaches to support “long-tail” models and data integration.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Linked Data paradigm emerged in the context of Semantic Web technologies for publishing and sharing data over the Web. It connects related individual Web resources in a Graph database, where resources represent the graph nodes, and an edge connects a pair of nodes. Publishing and linking scientific resources using Semantic Web technologies require that the user community follows the three principles of Linked Data:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Each resource needs to be represented using a unique Uniform Resource Identifier (URI), which consists of: (i) A Uniform Resource Locator (URL) to define the server path over the Web, and (ii) A Uniform Resource Name (URN) to describe the exact name of the resource.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The relationships between resources are described using the triple format, where a subject S has a predicate P with an object O. A predicate is either an undirected relationship (bi-directional), where it connects two entities in both ways or a directed relationship (uni-directional), where the presence of a relationship between two entities in one direction does not imply the presence of a reverse relationship. The triple format is the structure unit for the Linked Data system. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. The HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is used as a universal access mechanism for resources on the Web. \n",
    "\n",
    "For more information about linked data, please visit https://www.w3.org/standards/semanticweb/data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Geosemantics Integration Service (GSIS) is a playground to show a lot of these principles in practice with respect to Earth science. Below we show many of the endpoints available in the GSIS and how they can enable new ways to manage metadata about data and models. Some of these endpoints are currently used in production, others are proof of concept developement. The goal of this notebook is to show what is possible when using Linked Data approaches."

    "We will be interacting with two web services. The first is the Geosemantics Integration Service (GSIS) available at [http://hcgs.ncsa.illinois.edu](http://hcgs.ncsa.illinois.edu). This service provides support for standandard vocabularies and methods for transforming typical strings used for tracking time, space and physical variables into well formed Linked Data documents. The second service is the [NSF Intensively Managed Landscape Critical Zone Observatory](http://criticalzone.org/iml/) data management system (https://data.imlczo.org/). We will be retrieving data from it and uploading data and metadata back to it using the Clowder web service API. Clowder is a customizable and scalable data management system to support any data format. It is under active development and deployed for a variety of research projects. For more information about Clowder please visit https://clowderframework.org/. \n",

    "\n",
    "Since geospatial data comes in many formats, from shapefiles to geotiffs to comma-delimited text files, it is often helpfull to annotate the files with portable metadata that can be used to identify what each files contains. For geospatial data the temporal, spatial, and physical properties dimensions are important and often used to search over a large collection of data. The Geosemantics Integration Service (GSIS) provides a series of endpoints to simplify annotating geospatial data. It includes temporal endpoints so that generic formats for date and times can be translated to well formted JSON-LD formats. It includes the ability to store standard vocabularies as generic RDF graphs and retrieve those as simple JSON documents for easy integration in external services (for example Clowder). It also includes the ability to make links between terms from two different standard vocabularies using SKOS and OWN same as predicates."

    "\n",
    "The GSIS also prototyped a method to match simulations models to input datasets. Given definitions for both, the system checks if a specific variable is compatible between data and model. The user provides the id of an RDF graph representing a model, one of an RDF graph representing a dataset, and the RDF predicates used to identify the variables in each graph. It then tries to match the two lists leveraging the `skos:sameAs` crosswalks defined above. The results includes whether a match was found, what variables are missing if so, and what variables will require a crosswalk and potentially a conversion.\n",

    "## Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "This short notebook provides a few simple examples of developing web applications around the principles of Linked Data. By developing services built around interoperability, we hope it will be easier in the future to build services that can easily interoperate. Earth sciences provide unique challenges in that the way researchers store their data can vary greatly. The Linked Data approach can be useful in overcoming some of these challenges even thought it provides its own technical challenges in terms of adoption. Over time efforts like [Schema.org](https://schema.org/) are showing that the principles of Linked Data are important but that simplifying some of their approaches might be the key to widespread adoption. Even though the GSIS stores information as RDF graphs, it provides simple HTTP web services to make it easier to be used in the existing ecosystem of tools. Furthermore, the Clowder data framework provides simple GUI and APIs to store rich metadata documents next to the raw bytes, but it tries to find a good compromise between expressivenes of the metadata and simplicity of use."
